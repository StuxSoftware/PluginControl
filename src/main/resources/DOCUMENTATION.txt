             > A Server-Platform independent Plugin Controller! <

Overview
========
The goal of this project is to allow server administrator to provide a simple
yet powerful plugin that runs on as many server platforms.

All commands that are shown here, are available on all supported platforms!


Please note that the plugin name change while the plugin was developed, so
 the permission nodes are starting with "pluginmanager" instead of
 "plugincontrol".



Configuration
=============
Each server has its own directory where the configuration is stored.
Please follow the following instructions for your server.

The configuration file has comments describing each setting in the
configuration file.

Bukkit (and servers using its API)
----------------------------------
The configuration folder is inside the plugin folder and is named
"PluginControl". The main configuration file is "config.yml".

CanaryMod
---------
The configuration directory for this plugin is a subdirectory of the
global "config"-Directory. The directory is called "PluginControl".
The main configuration file is "config.yml"

Support
=======
Not all servers support some features of the plugin.

CraftBukkit and Spigot
----------------------
All features are supported.

MCPC+
-----
Forge-Mods are not supported. The install routine installs Bukkit-Plugins.

CanaryMod
---------
Only the recode versions are supported.
Due to the lack of a suitable repository for Plugins, there is no download,
query and update functionality for this server.

Table of features
-----------------

B = Servers implementing the Bukkit API
M = MCPC
R = CanaryMod Recode

x = Full Support
* = Partial Support
- = No Support

Localization
============
All localization information are stored in the "localization.lang"-File.
The syntax of the file is described there.
You can change the path of the language file in the "config.yml" of the
plugin.


Repositories
============
An important concept of the plugin is the "Repository"-System that allows
to use multiple sources of plugins. Each plugin and its metadata is
downloaded from a repository.

At least one repository is needed to perform any internet related actions.

Current supported repositories:
  Name                           Platform
-------------------------------------------------------
* DevBukkit                      Bukkit
